# Voice Memo Namer
Adds titles to iPhone voice memos transferred using iFunBox.

I made this script as I wanted to export a large amount of voice memos while retaining both titles and dates of recording. If you export from iTunes, you can only retain either titles or dates, but not both. Yes, iExplorer and iMazing are both able to export voice memos while retaining both titles and dates, but they both cost a fair bit of money and I didn't wanted to be able to complete this basic task for free.

## How to use:

1. Use [iFunbox](http://www.i-funbox.com/en/index.html) to transfer **all** the files under 'Voice Memos' into a folder
2. Add voicememonamer.py to the folder
3. Navigate to the folder using Terminal and run `python3 voicememonamer.py`
